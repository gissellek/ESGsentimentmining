# ESGsentimentmining
A Jupyter Notebook that gets the most recent news articles about a company and applies sentiment analysis to mine for an ESG score when given a ticker.

Note: to run the code you will need an API key from intrinio.com. The sandbox API key is free but will only give data for DOW 30 companies.

The financial sentiment word list documentation can be found at https://www3.nd.edu/~mcdonald/Word_Lists_files/Documentation/Documentation_LoughranMcDonald_MasterDictionary.pdf
